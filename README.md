## Current Focus
#### GenAI Security
🔭 I’m trying to develop innovative solutions using GenAI while focusing on securing GenAI systems. As GenAI becomes integral across industries, it poses significant risks to critical assets due to insufficient security practices. My goal is to ensure that as this technology evolves, its security keeps pace, protecting sensitive data and maintaining trust in AI-driven systems.

#### Open-source contributions 
Main focus this and upcoming year would be to contribute as much as possible to the open source community.
## Background/Experience

I’m a passionate **Security Engineer** with expertise in **Application Security** and **AI Security**. 

#### Security Engineer Intern at Flipkart  <img src="Flipkart logo.png" alt="flipkart-logo" width="20" height="20" /> <br>
I performed **Vulnerability Assessments/Penetration Testing** in-house applications, led **customized WAF deployments**, Contributed in **Threat Modelling** and **OSINT** and developed secure solutions for **GenAI** systems and overviewed **GenAI new additions** in the applications.
I’ve worked on impactful projects like a **GenAI-Powered PII Extractor** and a **Fraud Detection System** using anomaly detection techniques.
